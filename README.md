URL Stats Extractor (urlextractor)
============

A hacktastically simple Chrome extension that shows stats for shortened URLs.  If it finds URLs that can be analyzied, a addressbar icon will show up.  When you mouse over the shortened URL, a popup should appear giving some statistical information about that URL.  There's still a lot of issues with how well the system detects URLs in a page so bear with me.  It should work fine with static URLs, but dynamic ones, like Google+'s stream can cause problems.  Care to fix it?

Anyway, for now, the system supports:
* [goo.gl](http://goo.gl)

You can find the released version at the Chrome Webstore: [URL Stats Extractor](http://goo.gl/SZNDP).

Any questions or comments and fixes are more than welcome.  This is my starter project to introduce myself to git and GitHub so bear with me if I stumble with pulls and requests and whatnot.  You can reach me here, or on [Google+](http://goo.gl/j2cjL).
